# Fake Shop

This project is a sample e-commerce website built with Vue 3 and TypeScript. It features a login system, a product listing page, a product detail page, and a user profile page.

It includes the following features:

- Vue 3 with the Composition API
- TypeScript
- Vue Router for client-side routing
- Vuex for state management
- Axios for HTTP requests
- ESLint and Prettier for linting and code formatting
- https://api.escuelajs.co/api for product database and user authentication

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/<YOUR-REPO>.git
cd <YOUR-PROJECT-NAME>
npm install
```

Then, start the development server:

```sh
npm run serve
```

This will start a development server on http://localhost:8080. The application will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

## Building and Deployment

To build the application for production, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready build in the `dist` directory. You can then deploy the contents of this directory to your web server.
